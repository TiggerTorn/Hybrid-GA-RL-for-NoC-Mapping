# Hybrid-GA-RL-for-NoC-Mapping
This project implements a hybrid approach combining Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize application mapping in Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures. The goal is to reduce communication costs and improve system performance by leveraging the strengths of both GA's search capabilities and RL's adaptive learning.
